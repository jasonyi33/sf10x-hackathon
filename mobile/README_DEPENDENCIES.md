# Dependencies for Full Implementation

## Current Status
Tasks 4.1-4.3 are implemented with mock data and simplified navigation.

## Dependencies Required for Full Implementation

### When Tasks 1, 2, 3 are completed, install:

```bash
# Stack navigation dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler

# Backend API integration dependencies (if needed)
npm install axios
```

### What will be enabled:

1. **Stack Navigation**: IndividualProfileScreen will be accessible via navigation
2. **Backend Integration**: Real API calls instead of mock data
3. **Full Profile View**: Complete individual profile display with interaction history

## Current Implementation Notes

### What's Working Now:
- ✅ Tab navigation with icons
- ✅ Search functionality with mock data
- ✅ Individual profile screen (ready for navigation)
- ✅ Data consistency fix applied
- ✅ TypeScript types and interfaces

### What's Temporarily Disabled:
- ❌ Stack navigation (requires additional dependencies)
- ❌ Real API integration (requires backend from Tasks 1, 2, 3)
- ❌ Individual profile navigation (shows alert instead)

## Testing Current Implementation

The current implementation can be tested with:
- Tab navigation between screens
- Search functionality with mock data
- Data consistency (all showing ~565 days ago)

## Next Steps

1. Complete Tasks 1, 2, 3 (backend implementation)
2. Install required dependencies
3. Replace mock API calls with real backend calls
4. Test full navigation flow

## Files Modified for Cleanup

- `App.tsx`: Restored stack navigation structure
- `SearchScreen.tsx`: Restored proper navigation to profile
- Added dependency notes in both files
