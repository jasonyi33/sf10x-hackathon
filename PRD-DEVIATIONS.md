# PRD Deviations Tracking Document - Task 3 Focus

## Overview
This document tracks deviations from the original PRD (Product Requirements Document) specifically for **Task 3: AI Transcription & Categorization** (Dev 2's responsibility). Each deviation is categorized by functional requirement number and includes precise explanations of what was implemented versus what was specified.

## Scope: Task 3 - AI Transcription & Categorization
This analysis focuses only on the AI transcription and categorization functionality that Dev 2 is responsible for implementing. Other tasks (search, profiles, categories management, etc.) are outside Dev 2's scope and not included here.
