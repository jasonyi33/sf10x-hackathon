# Task 1.1 Complete: Database Migration Created

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Migration File
**File**: `/supabase/migrations/004_add_photos_age.sql`

This migration:
- ✅ Adds `photo_url` and `photo_history` columns to individuals table
- ✅ Creates `photo_consents` table for consent tracking
- ✅ Adds `approximate_age` as a required preset category (type: range)
- ✅ Updates ALL existing individuals to have `approximate_age: [-1, -1]`
- ✅ Creates performance indexes
- ✅ Includes helper RPC functions for testing

### 2. Created Comprehensive Tests
**File**: `/backend/tests/test_migration_004.py`

Tests verify:
- Photo columns exist with correct types
- Photo consents table has all required fields
- Approximate age category is properly configured
- All individuals have age field set to [-1, -1]
- Performance indexes are created

### 3. Created Test Runner
**File**: `/backend/tests/run_migration_test.py`

- Executable script to run tests before/after migration
- Shows expected failures before migration
- Provides clear instructions for applying migration
- Verifies success after migration

### 4. Created Documentation
**File**: `/supabase/migrations/004_migration_notes.md`

- Explains all changes made
- Documents age format requirements
- Provides testing instructions
- Includes rollback plan if needed

## Next Steps

### To Apply This Migration:

1. **Run tests to verify current state** (should fail):
   ```bash
   cd backend/tests
   python run_migration_test.py
   ```

2. **Apply the migration** using one of:
   - Supabase CLI: `supabase db push`
   - Or manually in Supabase SQL Editor

3. **Verify migration succeeded** (tests should pass):
   ```bash
   python run_migration_test.py
   ```

### Critical Reminders:
- ⚠️ Run migration BEFORE deploying any code changes
- ⚠️ Age format is ALWAYS `[min, max]` array, never single number
- ⚠️ Special value `[-1, -1]` means "Unknown"
- ⚠️ Age does NOT affect danger scores (weight = 0)

## Ready for Next Task
Task 1.1 is complete. The migration file and all supporting infrastructure are ready.
