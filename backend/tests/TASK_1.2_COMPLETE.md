# Task 1.2 Complete: Photos Bucket Created ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Test Suite
**File**: `/backend/tests/test_photos_bucket.py`

Comprehensive tests that verify:
- ✅ Photos bucket exists
- ✅ Bucket is public (but auth required)
- ✅ 5MB file size limit is enforced
- ✅ Only JPEG and PNG files are allowed
- ✅ Upload and public URL access work correctly
- ✅ No lifecycle rules (photos kept indefinitely)

### 2. Created Verification Scripts
- **`/backend/tests/verify_bucket_state.py`** - Quick check of bucket existence
- **`/backend/scripts/create_photos_bucket.py`** - Script to create bucket (already existed)

### 3. Storage Policies Created
**File**: `/backend/scripts/storage_policies.sql`

RLS policies for:
- Authenticated users can upload photos
- Authenticated users can view all photos
- Users can delete their own photos
- Public can view photos (for app display)

## Current Bucket Configuration

The `photos` bucket is successfully configured with:
```json
{
  "name": "photos",
  "public": true,
  "file_size_limit": 5242880,  // 5MB
  "allowed_mime_types": [
    "image/jpeg",
    "image/png"
  ]
}
```

## Test Results

All 6 tests passing:
```
✅ test_bucket_exists - Photos bucket found
✅ test_bucket_is_public - Correctly set as public
✅ test_file_size_limit - 5MB limit enforced
✅ test_allowed_mime_types - Only JPEG/PNG allowed
✅ test_bucket_upload_and_public_access - Upload works
✅ test_no_lifecycle_rules - Photos kept indefinitely
```

## Storage Path Structure

Photos will be stored using the pattern:
```
photos/{user_id}/{timestamp}.jpg
```

Example: `photos/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/1704384000000.jpg`

## Next Steps

### Apply Storage Policies
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `/backend/scripts/storage_policies.sql`
3. This will enable proper access control

### Continue with Phase 1
- ✅ Task 1.1: Database migration (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 1.2: Create photos bucket (COMPLETE)
- → Task 1.3: Update backend validation to require age

## Important Notes

1. **Public Access**: The bucket is public, meaning photos can be accessed via URL without authentication. However, the RLS policies ensure only authenticated users can upload/delete.

2. **File Size**: The 5MB limit is enforced at the storage level. Frontend should also validate before upload to provide better UX.

3. **MIME Types**: Only JPEG and PNG are allowed. The frontend will need to convert HEIC photos from iOS devices.

4. **Path Structure**: Using `{user_id}/{timestamp}.jpg` ensures:
   - Photos are organized by user
   - No naming conflicts
   - Easy to implement "delete own photos" policy

## Ready for Backend Integration

The storage infrastructure is now ready for:
- Photo upload endpoint implementation (Phase 2)
- Integration with individual save flow
- Photo history management
