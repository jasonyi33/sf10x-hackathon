# Task 2.15 End-to-End Test Summary

## Overview
All Task 2.15 individual management backend APIs have been fully implemented and tested according to PRD specifications.

## Test Results: ✅ ALL PASSED

### Scenario 1: Voice Entry with All Required Fields
- ✅ Successfully created individual from voice transcription
- ✅ All required fields (name, height, weight, skin_color) validated
- ✅ Location data stored with full address
- ✅ Transcription and audio_url preserved

### Scenario 2: Manual Entry Missing Required Fields  
- ✅ Validation correctly rejects missing required fields
- ✅ Returns appropriate error messages

### Scenario 3: Search Functionality
- ✅ Search by name working across name and JSONB data fields
- ✅ Pagination with limit/offset working
- ✅ Sorting by last_seen, danger_score, and name
- ✅ Abbreviated addresses in search results

### Scenario 4: Individual Details
- ✅ Full individual data retrieval
- ✅ Recent interactions included (last 10)
- ✅ Correct display_score calculation

### Scenario 5: Danger Override
- ✅ Manual danger override sets correctly (0-100)
- ✅ Null value removes override
- ✅ Display score shows override when set, calculated score when not

### Scenario 6: Merge Individuals
- ✅ Merge preserves individual ID
- ✅ Updated fields are saved correctly
- ✅ New fields are added to existing record
- ✅ Interaction created for merge operation

### Scenario 7: Interaction History
- ✅ Interactions returned in chronological order (newest first)
- ✅ Full addresses shown in interaction history
- ✅ Only changed fields tracked in each interaction
- ✅ Transcription preserved for voice entries

### Scenario 8: Auto-Trigger Danger Score
- ✅ Auto-trigger fields immediately set danger score to 100
- ✅ Works with fields marked as auto_trigger=true

### Scenario 9: Error Handling
- ✅ Invalid UUID returns 404/422
- ✅ Non-existent individual returns 404
- ✅ Invalid danger override value (>100) returns 422
- ✅ Missing auth returns 401/422

### Scenario 10: Performance
- ✅ Search response time < 1 second
- ✅ Handles 100+ individuals efficiently

## API Endpoints Tested

1. **POST /api/individuals**
   - Create new individual
   - Merge with existing individual
   - Required field validation
   - Danger score calculation

2. **GET /api/individuals**
   - Search by name and data fields
   - Pagination (limit/offset)
   - Sorting (last_seen, danger_score, name)
   - Display abbreviated addresses

3. **GET /api/individuals/{id}**
   - Full individual details
   - Recent interactions (last 10)
   - Display score calculation

4. **PUT /api/individuals/{id}/danger-override**
   - Set manual override (0-100)
   - Remove override (null)
   - Return all danger scores

5. **GET /api/individuals/{id}/interactions**
   - Full interaction history
   - Chronological order (newest first)
   - Full addresses
   - Changes tracking

## Key PRD Requirements Validated

### Required Fields
- ✅ Name (text) - required
- ✅ Height (number, 0-300) - required  
- ✅ Weight (number, 0-300) - required
- ✅ Skin Color (single-select: Light/Medium/Dark) - required

### Danger Score Calculation
- ✅ Only number and single_select types can have danger weights
- ✅ Auto-trigger fields immediately set score to 100
- ✅ Manual override via slider (0-100) sets danger_override field
- ✅ Display: Show override if set, otherwise calculated score

### Duplicate/Merge Logic
- ✅ Merge preserves individual ID
- ✅ Latest values override older values
- ✅ Only changed fields tracked in interactions

### Data Storage
- ✅ individuals table: Current aggregated state
- ✅ interactions table: Historical log of changes only
- ✅ Location stored with full address from frontend
- ✅ Transcription preserved for voice entries

### Performance
- ✅ Search limited to 100 results max
- ✅ Response time < 1 second
- ✅ Efficient pagination

## Hackathon Shortcuts Applied
- ✅ Simplified JWT validation (no signature check)
- ✅ CORS allow all origins
- ✅ Fixed demo user name
- ✅ Basic error handling

## Ready for Frontend Integration
All endpoints are fully functional and tested. Frontend teams can now:
1. Save individuals from voice transcription
2. Search and display individuals
3. View detailed profiles with history
4. Set manual danger overrides
5. Handle duplicate merging

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run comprehensive test
python3 -m pytest tests/test_task_2_15_end_to_end.py -v -s

# Result: 1 passed in 0.71s
```
