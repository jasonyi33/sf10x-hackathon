# SF PulsePoint 3D Map - TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Project Setup & Dependencies
- [x] Install deck.gl core packages (@deck.gl/core, @deck.gl/react, @deck.gl/layers)
- [x] Install deck.gl advanced packages (@deck.gl/geo-layers, @deck.gl/extensions, @deck.gl/mesh-layers)
- [x] Install MapTiler SDK (@maptiler/sdk)
- [x] Install deck.gl MapBox integration (@deck.gl/mapbox)
- [x] Configure MapTiler API key (NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY)

### Basic Integration
- [x] Create SanFrancisco3D React component
- [x] Set up MapTiler + deck.gl hybrid rendering
- [x] Fix MapTiler style configuration (use explicit style URL)
- [x] Resolve CSS layout issues (main container width)
- [x] Configure San Francisco coordinates and 3D view settings
- [x] Add error handling for MapTiler initialization

### Development Environment
- [x] Set up Next.js development server
- [x] Configure hot reload and development tools
- [x] Resolve 404 errors (development source maps - harmless)
- [x] Handle MapTiler sprite image warnings (cosmetic)

## üîÑ In Progress

### 3D Visualization Activation
- [ ] Add 3D building layer to deck.gl overlay
- [ ] Implement GeoJsonLayer with building extrusion
- [ ] Test with sample building data

## üìã Next Steps - Phase 1: Basic 3D Buildings

### Data Integration
- [ ] **Option A**: Integrate SF Open Data building footprints
  - [ ] Connect to: https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Building-Footprints/ynuv-fyni
  - [ ] Parse GeoJSON format
  - [ ] Extract height properties
- [ ] **Option B**: Use deck.gl sample Vancouver buildings for quick testing
- [ ] **Option C**: Implement OpenStreetMap building data via Overpass API

### 3D Building Visualization
- [ ] Configure GeoJsonLayer with following properties:
  - [ ] `extruded: true` for 3D effect
  - [ ] `getElevation: (f) => f.properties.height || 20`
  - [ ] `getFillColor: [180, 180, 180, 200]` (gray buildings)
  - [ ] `getLineColor: [80, 80, 80, 255]` (darker outlines)
- [ ] Add buildings to MapboxOverlay layers array
- [ ] Test 3D rendering performance

### Interactive Features
- [ ] Enable building hover effects (`pickable: true`)
- [ ] Add tooltip with building information
- [ ] Implement smooth camera controls
- [ ] Add zoom level optimization

## üìã Next Steps - Phase 2: Enhanced Features

### Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Color code buildings by:
  - [ ] Height (gradient from low to high)
  - [ ] Building type (residential, commercial, mixed-use)
  - [ ] Construction year/age
- [ ] Add building shadows and lighting effects
- [ ] Implement wireframe toggle option
- [ ] Add animation transitions

### Data Layers
- [ ] Add San Francisco neighborhoods overlay
- [ ] Integrate transportation lines (Muni, BART)
- [ ] Add parks and open spaces
- [ ] Include water bodies (SF Bay)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for buildings
- [ ] Add viewport-based data filtering
- [ ] Optimize for mobile devices
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries

## üìã Phase 3: Dashboard Integration

### PulsePoint Features
- [ ] Connect to backend API for real-time data
- [ ] Add data visualization overlays (heatmaps, points)
- [ ] Implement filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Add export capabilities (screenshots, data)

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add map control panel (zoom, rotate, tilt)
- [ ] Implement legend and information panel
- [ ] Add style selector (day/night mode)
- [ ] Create responsive design for different screen sizes

### Production Ready
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Error monitoring and logging
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## üîß Technical Debt & Fixes

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add unit tests for map components
- [ ] Set up E2E testing with Playwright

### Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to components
- [ ] Create user guide for map interactions
- [ ] Document API integration patterns
- [ ] Create deployment guide

## üéØ Current Priority

**IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK**: Add 3D building layer to the existing MapTiler + deck.gl setup

**Steps**:
1. Update SanFrancisco3D.js to include building layer in MapboxOverlay
2. Add sample building data or connect to SF Open Data
3. Configure building extrusion and styling
4. Test 3D rendering and performance

## üìù Notes

- MapTiler API key: Working and configured
- Base map: Successfully rendering San Francisco streets with terrain
- deck.gl: All required packages installed
- CSS Layout: Fixed container sizing issues
- Console Errors: Only harmless development 404s and sprite warnings

## üé® Design Considerations

- Keep buildings subtle gray to maintain focus on data overlays
- Ensure 3D effects don't interfere with dashboard functionality
- Maintain performance for real-time data updates
- Consider accessibility for color-blind users
- Plan for mobile responsiveness
